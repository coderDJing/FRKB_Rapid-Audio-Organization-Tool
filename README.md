## What It Is

**FRKB** is a desktop audio workflow tool for DJs and music collectors who need to organize, preview, analyze, and prepare large track libraries quickly. It combines real file-based library management, SET playlist preparation, waveform browsing, fingerprint deduplication, Rekordbox and Pioneer library access, dual-deck auditioning, recording, metadata cleanup, conversion, similar-track discovery, cloud fingerprint sync, and Mixtape preparation in one Windows/macOS app.

FRKB is built around a simple rule: the structure you see in the app should match the actual music files on disk. It is not just a reference manager. When you organize, move, export, deduplicate, or restore tracks, the file system stays aligned with your library.

## Download

1. Download FRKB from the website or GitHub Releases.
   - Website: https://coderDJing.github.io/FRKB_Rapid-Audio-Organization-Tool/
   - Releases: https://github.com/coderDJing/FRKB_Rapid-Audio-Organization-Tool/releases
2. Pick the Windows or macOS installer.
3. Install and launch FRKB from the desktop shortcut or application launcher.

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later (x64)
- macOS 12 or later

FRKB does not provide an official Linux release.

## Feature Overview

### Library Organization

- **Real file management**: FRKB manages the audio files themselves, so playlists and library folders stay reflected on disk.
- **Filter and Curated libraries**: A two-stage DJ workflow for fast triage and long-term selection.
- **SET playlists**: Prepare performance sets as mapping-based playlists that support duplicate entries, stable track indices, drag reordering, and deletion protection for referenced source tracks.
- **Drag-and-drop import and movement**: Import files or folders, move tracks between playlists, and drag copies out to Explorer/Finder with Ctrl/Option.
- **Safe recycle bin**: Deleted tracks and deduplicated items go to FRKB's recycle bin and can be restored to their original playlists.
- **Playlist cleanup tools**: Clear playlists with visible progress, batch rename playlist tracks, clean missing external-library records, and keep selection counts visible before bulk operations.
- **Portable library state**: Library data can be moved with the music collection for use across devices.

### Deduplication, Analysis, And Metadata

- **Song deduplication**: Detect duplicate tracks by content hash or whole-file hash. Content hash mode ignores metadata differences such as cover art, title, and artist.
- **Playlist fingerprint deduplication**: Analyze a playlist and move duplicates to the recycle bin in one workflow.
- **BPM and beat-grid analysis**: Analyze tempo and grid placement, tap BPM manually, restore system-analyzed BPM, and work with stricter grid candidate rules for difficult tracks.
- **Key analysis**: Display musical key in Classic notation such as `C#m` or Camelot notation such as `1A/1B`.
- **Visible analysis progress**: Track-level analysis status is surfaced in the song list instead of leaving background work invisible.
- **Manual analysis control**: Playlist analysis can be confirmed, skipped, or started manually, so imported crates do not unexpectedly consume foreground playback resources.
- **Fingerprint library scanning**: Build a reusable fingerprint library from selected libraries to make future deduplication and similar-track workflows faster and more consistent.
- **External-source analysis cache**: Rekordbox, Pioneer USB, and ordinary external tracks can reuse cached analysis data instead of repeatedly reprocessing the same files.
- **Metadata editing and online fill**: Edit tags and cover art, search MusicBrainz, use AcoustID/Chromaprint matching, and batch-fill metadata.
- **Native Chromaprint fingerprinting**: AcoustID fingerprint generation runs through the native module for lower overhead during metadata matching.

### Playback And Waveforms

- **Wide format playback**: Built-in media tooling supports common and professional audio formats without sending files through another app first.
- **Selectable playback range**: Start and stop playback within a chosen section when only part of a track needs to be checked.
- **Output device selection**: Play through a selected audio device or follow the system default.
- **Multiple waveform styles**: SoundCloud-style waveform, detailed waveform, RGB energy view, list waveform previews, and single-track editing waveforms.
- **Large waveform browsing**: Dual-track and edit-mode waveforms support precise seeking, cue placement, grid inspection, and smooth redraw during playback.
- **Lightweight waveform caches**: RGB display data and surface-specific caches keep large waveforms, list previews, and Mixtape timelines responsive across repeat visits.
- **Title-bar audio visualization**: Monitor playback energy from the title bar without giving up screen space.
- **File association and external playback**: Open supported audio files from the system and audition them temporarily without importing them into the library.
- **Global shortcuts**: Control playback while the window is minimized, with configurable show/hide behavior.

### Dual-Deck Browse Mode

- **Side-by-side auditioning**: Browse two tracks at once in a DJ mixer-style interface.
- **Deck controls**: Each deck has transport controls, waveform display, Hot Cue, Memory Cue, Loop, Quantize, and beat-grid tools.
- **Mixer controls**: Use independent deck volume faders, channel controls, and a crossfader to judge transitions quickly.
- **Beat Sync and Master behavior**: Sync tempo and grid behavior between decks while keeping visible waveform scale stable.
- **Tempo nudge**: Temporarily push a deck faster or slower with hold controls, then return cleanly to the base tempo.
- **Auto Gain**: Match deck loudness against the current master so A/B comparisons are not distorted by level differences.
- **Cue monitoring**: Monitor cue output per deck while preparing comparisons.
- **Recording**: Record the dual-deck output to high-quality WAV and save it directly into the Recording Library.
- **Monitor-only metronome**: Use the beat-grid metronome while listening without printing the metronome into recorded audio.

### Recording Library

- **Dedicated recording area**: Recordings are stored in a separate Recording Library instead of being mixed into the normal organization flow.
- **High-quality WAV output**: Recordings are saved as uncompressed WAV with the current output device sample rate.
- **Live duration display**: The recording control shows millisecond-level duration while recording.
- **Post-recording summary**: After stopping, FRKB shows the saved file name, format, duration, and path.
- **Analysis isolation**: Recording-library files are excluded from normal background analysis candidates so fresh recordings do not steal resources from library work.

### Rekordbox And Pioneer Library Integration

- **Local Rekordbox database browsing**: Read Rekordbox playlists directly without manually exporting XML first.
- **Cue and Loop support**: Read Hot Cues, Memory Cues, and Loop data from Rekordbox/Pioneer sources and preserve them when copying into local FRKB libraries.
- **Rekordbox playlist operations**: Browse playlists, reorder tracks, create or move playlist nodes where supported, and export XML for Pioneer workflows.
- **Pioneer USB support**: Read Device Library and OneLibrary USB structures, including playlist trees, waveform previews, multi-drive identity, and track playback.
- **External-library context menus**: Use familiar right-click actions on Rekordbox and Pioneer rows, including copying to Filter or Curated libraries.
- **Keyboard multi-selection**: Select multiple songs in Rekordbox/Pioneer lists with keyboard-style range selection.
- **Curated artist import**: Import curated artist data from Rekordbox and Pioneer USB libraries to keep selection tags useful across sources.
- **Missing-file handling**: Missing source files are clearly marked, blocked from playback, and can be cleaned from Rekordbox playlist records when appropriate.

### Mixtape And Stem Workflow

- **Mixtape timeline workspace**: Arrange tracks on a timeline, preview transitions, edit beat alignment, and export a timeline-accurate result.
- **Cross-window track drag-in**: Drag songs from the main library directly into the Mixtape workspace.
- **Beat alignment tools**: Adjust grids, preview alignment on unified waveform controls, use metronome tools, and keep timeline playback aligned with edited grid data.
- **Gain, BPM, mute, and loop controls**: Shape the mix with timeline controls, envelopes, mute sections, loop overlays, and undo support.
- **Stem preparation**: Managed Stem runtime, separation cache management, ONNX fast separation, and DirectML/XPU acceleration support auto-recording and mix preparation workflows.

### Export, Conversion, And Formats

- **Track export**: Export selected tracks to a folder and optionally delete the source entries after export.
- **Persistent export destination**: Export dialogs remember the last destination and validate that it still exists.
- **Standalone conversion**: Convert audio files without first importing them into the main library.
- **Batch conversion with cancel**: Long conversion jobs show progress, can be canceled, and summarize completed, skipped, failed, and canceled items.
- **One-click MP3 conversion**: Convert non-MP3 tracks from the context menu while skipping existing converted copies.

- **Curated artist sync**: Split and link multi-artist tracks and sync curated artist data across devices.
- **Internationalization**: Built-in Simplified Chinese and English language packs.

## Project Background

As a DJ, I need to organize large batches of music files quickly. Many existing tools either require too much mouse work, use shortcuts that are not comfortable for long sessions, or only organize references while leaving the actual folders messy. FRKB exists to make library work faster, more physical, and less fragile: sort the music, hear the music, move the real files, and keep the structure usable outside the app.
